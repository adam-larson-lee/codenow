What we have here is a Node CLI to facilitate managing multiple repositories locally.

Right now it simply supports options to open VS Code and a terminal in a repository, where the root directory of your source code is configured.

Currently to install you need to clone the repo and install from the repository using npm install -g.

The following operatins systems are supported:

## Windows

IDE: VS Code

Shell: Powershell

## Xubuntu

IDE: VS Code

Shell: xfce4-terminal

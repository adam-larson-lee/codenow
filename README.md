What we have here is a Node CLI to facilitate managing multiple repositories locally. Currently it supports:

Windows - VS Code, Powershell
Xubuntu - VS Code, xfce4-terminal

Right now it simply supports options to open VS Code and a terminal in a repository, where the root directory of your source code is configured.

Currently to install you need to clone the repo and install from the repository using npm install -g.

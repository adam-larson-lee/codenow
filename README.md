What we have here is a Node CLI to facilitate managing multiple repositories locally. Right now it it can open VS Code or Powershell in a repository whose root path is set in configuration.

I'll be updating this over time with some extra CLI options and things that I'll post updates to here.

Currently to install you need to clone the repo and install from the repository using npm install -g.
